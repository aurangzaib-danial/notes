# Async vs Threads
## Async
It all about running multiple processes on the same thread. Javascript is an excellent language for async programming. This allows us to do parallel and concurrent jobs. 

## Threads
By default languages run on one thread. Ruby does not have good support for async processes, however, for concurrent jobs we use multiple threads.
- Threads are hard on system
- Take up a lot of memory
- It is not easy to setup multiple threads.
- We can only do concurrent jobs with threads but not asynchronous programming.
- But awesome for request/response cycle.
