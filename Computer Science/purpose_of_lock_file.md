# Purpose of lock file
Lock files are generated by package managers like bundler and yarn. These files are the locked down versions for libraries. Whenever someone tries to try our project in development, their package manager will always install packages with exact versions mentioned in the lock file.

```ruby
# Gemfile.lock => bundler
# package-lock.json => npm
# yarn.lock => yarn
```
