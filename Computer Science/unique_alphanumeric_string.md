## Unique Alphanumeric string

Through some crazy science, computers can generate unique strings that have not been generated ever before.

This is why every Internet device has a unique mac address in the entire world.

If I generate a unique string through a computer then the probability of that same string being generated by any other computer in the world is negligible.

## Generating a unique string using ruby

```ruby
  require 'securerandom'

  SecureRandom.hex
```
