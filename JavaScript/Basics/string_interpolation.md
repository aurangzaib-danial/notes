# String interpolation
We use the so-called template literals for interpolating strings.

```js
let name = 'Sunny';
let sentence = `My name is ${name}.`; 
/*
wrap string with back ticks
use ${} for embedding evaluation
this interpolation only works with back ticks.
template literals can also be multi-line
*/
console.log(sentence);
```

A string that is wrapped with back-ticks is called a **template literal**.
