# AD Khan's Notes
This repository is for storing my personal notes. I :heart: markdown and it's my preferred way of taking notes because of its simplicity. Moreover, GitHub flavored markdown allows me to use delicious syntax highlightning and through GitHub iOS app, I can always beautifully view my markdown notes on my phone.

**Thank you, Github!**
