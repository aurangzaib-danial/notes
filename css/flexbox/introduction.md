# Flexbox
## History
- Flexbox is a new method in CSS that was introduced for creating complex layouts.
- Flexbox is not a CSS property but rather different CSS rules.
- Layout methods like floats, display: inline and positioning were not created for managing layouts. However, everyone ended up using it because flexbox was not available until recently.
- It is much more easier and fun to make layouts in CSS with flexbox.

## Features
- The two main components of flexbox are flex container and flex items.
- The first step for using flexbox is to define a flex container.
- Any block or inline element can be a flex container and all of the child elements of the container are called flex items.
- There can be any number of flex items in a flex container.
- We can arrange the order of items in a flex container in any order we want, regardless of the order they come in the HTML code.

## Main Axis and Cross Axis
- These are two axis that flexbox uses to arrange flex items.
- Main axis is horizontal.
- Cross axis is vertical.

### Main Axis
This is horizontal and its length is as much as the width of the flex items.

### Cross Axis
This is vertical and the height of the flex items will automatically increase as the height of the container increases.
