## vh sizing unit
- vh stands for viewport height.
- 1 vh is equal to 1% of entire viewport height.

## calc function
- This allows us to perform mathematically operations in css without having to do them manually. 
- It's also very smart as above we did `calc(100vh - 90px)`, it can convert the `100vh` into pixels and then minus `90` out of it, automatically.
