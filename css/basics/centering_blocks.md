# Centering Blocks
- Centralization is important for easy reading.
- We center a section using `margin: 0 auto;` 
- Setting the margin auto for left and right uses the space remaining in the row after the block width takes space and then divides the remaining space into equal margin from left and right. The section always remains centralized.

## Rules for centering blocks
- Must be a block level element
- Not floated
- Must have a width, its width should not be auto
