# Media queries
- Media is plural for medium and medium is the screen. 
- A media query triggers depending on the size of the screen. 
- The point at where the query triggers is called a break point.

## Media query with multiple conditions
```css
@media only screen and (min-width: 400px) and (max-width: 1000px) {
    /* write css selectors */
}
```
