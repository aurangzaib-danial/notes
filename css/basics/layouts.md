# Layouts
## Mobile first approach
- This approach is much more logical than desktop-first approach because it is based on progressive enhancement.
- Desktop-first layouts become complex quickly and it becomes really difficult to bring them down to a smaller level.
- Mobile-first approach starts from a one-column layout and then we can keep enhancing it according to our requirement, without over-complicating.
