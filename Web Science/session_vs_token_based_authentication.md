# Session vs Token based authentication

## Session based
This is most common goto for web apps. It is really awesome and easy to implement. It is perfect to use and there is nothing bad about them.

## Token based authentication
When we use a framework like React for front-end and want our Rails app to just be a back-end api then we use token based authentication. I want to generally avoid this and only use it for native apps.
