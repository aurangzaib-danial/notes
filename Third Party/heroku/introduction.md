# Introduciton
Heroku is a platform as a service (PaaS). It allows developers to focus on building apps and then forget about the complexity of deploying the apps. It handles deployment of apps so much nicely that I think its made out of my love of building app. 

## Addons
Heroku addons are allowing other third party software to enhance our app capabilities. For example, postgres is an addon on heroku, it is something not offered by heroku but a third party. Addons can be free and paid as well. We can add as many addons we like.

## Procfile
Procfile is made in your root directory of app and its used by heroku. In this you can define, commands that should be run before deploying your app.
