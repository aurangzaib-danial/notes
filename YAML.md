# YAML
It is a set of rules to save representations of objects like arrays, hashes etc on text files. This way we can retrieve those objects later for use.

- YAML is important because there needs to be a way to reuse objects and their data later.
- Instead of coming up with our own weird ways of saving files, we can use the true and test YAML.
- YAML is not limited to a single language. It can be used by any language.
- Ruby comes with YAML by default.
- A file of YAML can only represent one type of object on the top level. The nested nodes can be of any type. However, there can only be one parent.
