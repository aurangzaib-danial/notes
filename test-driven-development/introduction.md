# Introduction
>Test driven development is considered the most reliable methodology for delivery quality code.

## An excerpt from Rails guides
> Let's talk about unit tests. Unit tests are code that tests and makes assertions about code. In unit testing, we take a little part of code, say a method of a model, and test its inputs and outputs. Unit tests are your friend. The sooner you make peace with the fact that your quality of life will drastically increase when you unit test your code, the better.
