# Support
This pattern is used for adding custom configuration to RSpec instead of editing the **spec_helper**

## Steps
1. Create a folder inside spec called support
2. Create a file according to the name of customization that we are going to add to RSpec.
3. Require this file inside the spec or rails helper.
