# Best Practices
- A unit test is testing something in isolation. Write unit tests in which each test only one kind of functionality.
- It is perfectly fine to write a test, see it fail and then make it pass. We do not have to pass them all in one go.
- Create one feature at a time using TDD
- Never implement solution inside a test.
- Never test frameworks, they are already tested by their maintainers.
- Our programs strengths are determined by the efficiency of our tests.
- Tests are built by programmers themselves. If our tests are buggy then they won't test our programs the right way.
- Test should not be too much strict, which can make impossible for our programs to grow.
- Best programming is done through TDD. Logic should always be tested using TDD. Manual testing is nuts.
