It is a way to describe a pattern in a string. 

Every text in computers are just characters. These characters follow a sequence. These group of charaters is also called String. Regular Expression help us find the characters according to our pattern.

All we have to do is describe our pattern in regex keywords and then matching characters will be returned to us by the computer.
