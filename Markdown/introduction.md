# Markdown

Markdown is a set of rules for formatting the text that we write. It's mostly used for rendering a document on the web without writing HTML. HTML can be complex while markdown is really simple.

Other than HTML, markdown is also great for writing any kind of document. In terms of a programmer, it's great for taking notes.

**For example**

- A note taking application has a ton of features that end up cluttering the screen. 
- I personally, want to write using just my keyboard. Markdown allows me to format text as I write without ever leaving my keyboard. 
- In a simple text editor like sublime, I can write without any distraction.
- Writing in Sublime feels like writing on a scratchpad. 
- I can really focus on my text, without worrying about the formatting and utilize the power of sublime text.
