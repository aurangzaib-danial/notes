# Lists

- Creating lists is easy in markdown.
- Two types of lists ordered and unordered.
- Stars(\*) or dashes(-) for unordered lists
- Numbers for ordered lists
- We can nest lists as well.
    - Generally we should not nest more than 3 levels.
    - We can make a nesting by combining ordererd and unordered lists.
    - Nest using 4 spaces.

```md
  1. Step 1
  2. Step 2
      - foo
      - bar
  3. Step 3 

```

We can make paragraphs in each list item by adding newline between text and then adding indentation. Use soft breaks instead of hard breaks.

```md
  1. This is text.  
     Text continued
  2. Next line
```
