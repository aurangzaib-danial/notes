# Tips
Most often, its better to make more commits rather than less.
Commit code whenever you've completed any particular thing you're proud of, or when you're done with a specific task. 

It is possible to access any of these commits in the future, in the event that you need to roll back to a previous version of a repository, or want to look at some code from the past you've since removed. 

More commits with specific messages regarding what was accomplished means a clearer picture of the path you took to create a project.

Make sure to commit early and commit often. Commit messages should be meaningful (clearly describe what you're doing in the commit) and accurate (there should be nothing in the commit that doesn't match the description in the commit message). Good rule of thumb is to commit every 3-7 mins of actual coding time. Most of your commits should have under 15 lines of code and a 2 line commit is perfectly acceptable.
