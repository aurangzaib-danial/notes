# Basics
Basic pillars of a language
1. Sequencing (semi-colon)
2. Control flow (logic)
3. Iteration

## Class
- All the classes require a main method for the code to run.
- At least one class is required for a Java program to run.

## Initializing a constant
- All caps for data constants and use snake_case for multiple words.
- PascalCase for class declaration.

```java
final String GREETING = "Hola!";
```
