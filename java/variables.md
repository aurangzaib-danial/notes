# Variables

## Main types
1. int
2. double
3. float (single precision floating point)
4. char (single character)
5. boolean
6. String
7. long (large integers)

## Declaration
```java
String name = 'Sunny';
int students = 10;
double the_pi = 3.14;
```

## Typecasting
We cannot set the type of a variable to another type by setting a new value. However, we can change the type of a value.

```java
double pi = 3.14;
int whole_pi = (int) pi;
```

## Scope
- Only limited to methods. No fancy leakage.
