# Data structures
## Arrays
- Only one type of data can be stored in an array.
- Array's in java only have fixed length. It's important we specify length for arrays with dummy values, if we want to work with it later.

```java
String [] students = {"Sunny", "Ali", "Hamza"};
int [] evens = {2, 4, 6};
// properties
students.length //=> 3

// create a fixed length array with dummy values
int[] evens = new int[10];
```
