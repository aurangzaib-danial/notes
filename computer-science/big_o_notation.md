# Big O Notation
This term is a method for describing the complexity of an algorithm. By complexity we mean, what kind of pattern the algorithm uses and estimating how much time it would take to execute.

With Big O Notation, we are able to find out effectiveness of the algorithm as well as the deficiencies.

For example, Big O Notation for a **bubble sort** is O(n<sup>2</sup>).
1. **O** represents Big O Notation.
2. n<sup>2</sup> represent the complexity of **bubble sort**. In this case, it means that it takes twice the amount of work for a computer to implement a **bubble sort**.
