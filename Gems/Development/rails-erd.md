# Rails ERD

## Generates entity relation diagram based on the models in a Rails application.

```ruby
gem 'rails-erd', group: :development

## Also need grapViz, install through homebrew
## brew install graphviz
```

# Usage
Inside a rails app run following

```console
$ bundle exec erd
```

## Shows errors while generating erd for Rails 6 but I should ignore them.
