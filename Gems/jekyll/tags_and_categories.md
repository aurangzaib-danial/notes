# Tags and Categories
These have important differences.

## Catogories
These are for grouping posts having different tags but belong to a single group.

## Tags
There are for micro-grouping posts of a category.

We can define category and tags for a post in the front-matter.

```yaml
category: programming # single category
categories: programming coder # this will create programming category with coder as a sub-category
# link will be accessed as
# blog.com/programming/coder/20/11/22/i-love-programmign/
tags: ruby rails # multiple tags
```
