# Introduction
Jekyll is a Ruby gem that allows us to generate static websites that we can easily deploy to GitHub pages. Generating websites using jekyll allows us to use features like partials, includes etc. GitHub pages is the best place to easily host static websites with custom domains.

## Brief intro to GitHub pages
This feature allows us to host a branch of a respository as a static website. We have to enable GitHub pages on a repository branch to make it accessible on the internet.

For personal respository: [aurangzaib-danial.github.io](aurangzaib-danial.github.io)

For any other respository: [aurangzaib-danial.github.io/respository-name](aurangzaib-danial.github.io/respository-name)

The root of the branch will be accessible on the internet if we enable GitHub pages for it. Either we use plain static files or if we have jekyll in the Gemfile of the respository, the website will be automatically generated by Github whenever there is a commit.

We can also use custom-domains for GitHub pages.

**Note: Github-pages does not use latest version of Jekyll. Currently, 3.9.0 is supported in Github environment.**
