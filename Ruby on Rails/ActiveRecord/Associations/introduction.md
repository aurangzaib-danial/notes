ActiveRecord through its powerful macros, adds methods to our objects through which we can associate objects.

At the end, all that association macros give us are just **methods**.

## Associations supported by ActiveRecord
- belongs_to
- has_one
- has_many
- has_many :through
- has_one :through
- has\_and\_belongs\_to\_many

Also, polymorphic associations.
