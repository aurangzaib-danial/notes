# Abstract Controllers

Devise gem comes with some pre-built controllers. These controllers are very abstract and flexible. They can work with any kind of model. It is because of this behaviour, we can have multiple authentication models. 

It's not common to have more than one authentication model but still even if we have just one model, we can just use devise controllers rather than building model specific controllers.


**NOTE: devise_for looks at the 'User' model and only generates routes for the modules that are enabled in the model.**

```ruby
  devise_for :users #=> This is a very interesting macro, routes that are generated are mapped to devise controllers.

  # Some routes generated by above macro

  get 'users/sign_in', to: 'devise/sessions#new'
  post 'users/sign_in', to: 'devise/sessions#create'

  delete 'users/sign_out', to: 'devise/sessions#destroy'


  get 'users/sign_up', to: 'devise/registration#new'


  # As default controllers are abstract

  devise_for :members

  get 'members/sign_in', to: 'devise/sessions#new'

```

As we can see, these controllers introspect on the route and invoke the approriate model for authentication. 

This way we do not have to copy redundant controllers to our application codebase. However, devise allows us to customize the default devise controllers as well by creating our own controllers. But the devise default controllers in most cases get the job done.

## My point of view

I really like this notion that I download a gem like devise and use its controllers for any of my model without creating any controller file in my project.
