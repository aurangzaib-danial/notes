# Introduction
Node is built using JavaScript. It's sole purpose is to compile JavaScript code and run it in the server instead of the browser.

## Why node is not called JavaScript itself?
The problem is even JavaScript is not called JavaScript. The real name for JavaScript is EcmaScript. The creator of node instead of naming it after JavaScript, he named it after node for disambiguating i.e. are we running JS on a browser or a server.

Because JS in browser is totaly different. It has access to DOM and many other browser related features. While, node allows you to require third party modules and interaction with the entire server.
